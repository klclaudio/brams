# BRAMS 6.0 - INSTALL GUIDE

Before you install the model BRAMS-6.0  you must have the prerequisites installed. See the document  [BRAMS_6.0_-_INSTALL_PREREQUISITES](http://ftp.cptec.inpe.br/pesquisa/bramsrd/BRAMS-6.0/docs/BRAMS_6.0_-_INSTALL_PREREQUISITES.html) (extension md or html) to see how to install the requisites. **Even you believe the system are ready, please, read the prerequisites document.**

_Minimum system requirement for Brams install and run small test case:_

* Hard Disk - 16GB
* Memory - 8GB
* GNU Linux system


## 1. Building PATHS and linking compilers.
   
   In order to compiler the BRAMS code using the compilers and libraries you install in prerequisites make the commands below.
   
   ```bash
   export PATH={YOUR_DIR}/bin:$PATH
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH={YOUR_DIR}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ln -s /usr/bin/gfortran {YOUR_DIR}/bin/gfortran
   ln -s /usr/bin/gcc {YOUR_DIR}/bin/gcc
   ```
   
   > Notice: See the prerequisites document to use the correct {YOUR_DIR}. <mark> Pay attention in correct compiler you are using, and use full address! </mark>
   
   Please, check if your path have in first part **{YOUR_DIR}** and if the correct library is in first part of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  
   
   If you have doubt please, read the prerequisites' doc and use the alias you build (see 9. in prerequisites)
   
   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ```
   
   Please check if Fortran and C version is the correct. (The example is only for Gnu. You must change if use another compiler) 
   
   ```bash
   gfortran --version
   gcc --version
   ```
   
   The results must be something like. See that in this case we use 8.4.0.
   
   ```
   $ gfortran --version
   GNU Fortran (Ubuntu 8.4.0-4ubuntu1) 8.4.0
   Copyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
   This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
   warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
   $ gcc --version
   gcc (Ubuntu 8.4.0-4ubuntu1) 8.4.0
   Copyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
   This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO

   ```

## 2. Download and configure the model

   You can download BRAMS in the directory **{INSTALL_DIR}** from GitHub.

   ```bash
   cd {INSTALL_DIR}
   wget https://github.com/luflarois/brams/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
   unzip master.zip
   ```
   
   Now you must configure the model passing all libraries you will be use. The **{YOUR_DIR}/bin**  or {YOUR_BIN_AREA} is the folder you want to put the binary and namelists of model. The folder **{YOUR_DIR}** used to put the libraries, includes and executables it contains the repositories: bin/, lib/, include/ and share they are filled by make install command,  see item 3 below. The **{INSTALL_DIR}** is  BRAMS and prerequisites source directory.
   
   ```bash
   cd {INSTALL_DIR}/brams-master/build
   ./configure --program-prefix=BRAMS_6.0 --prefix={YOUR_DIR} --enable-jules --with-chem=RELACS_TUV --with-aer=SIMPLE --with-fpcomp={YOUR_DIR}/bin/mpif90 --with-cpcomp={YOUR_DIR}/bin/mpicc --with-fcomp={YOUR_DIR}/bin/{your_fortran_compiler} --with-ccomp={YOUR_DIR}/bin/{your_C_compiler} --with-netcdff={YOUR_DIR} --with-netcdfc={YOUR_DIR} --with-wgrib2={YOUR_DIR}
   ```

   Below an example using Gnu, where {YOUR_DIR} as /opt/apps and {Install_DIR} as /home/oscar.
   
   ```bash
   cd /home/oscar/brams-master/build ./configure --program-prefix=BRAMS_6.0 --prefix=/opt/apps --enable-jules --with-chem=RELACS_TUV --with-aer=SIMPLE --with-fpcomp=/opt/apps/bin/mpif90 --with-cpcomp=/opt/apps/bin/mpicc --with-fcomp=/opt/apps/bin/gfortran --with-ccomp=/opt/apps/bin/gcc --with-netcdff=/opt/apps --with-netcdfc=/opt/apps --with-wgrib2=/opt/apps
   ```
   > Notice: In the example above compilers have full addresses, it is usefull when you intall Brams with scripts. 
   >
   > Notice: BRAMS can work without the GRIB2 (Wgrib2) library configuring without option --with-wgrib2, however some template startup features may be unavailable. For initial tests with pre-generated data this library is not required."

## 3. Make and make install
   
   The make command will create the brams-6.0 executable. After creation it is necessary to run the make install command so that the basic files for the run are copied to the area set in {YOUR_DIR}.
   
   ```bash
   make
   make install
   ```
   
   The output of BRAMS's model is presented with colors in terminal. If you save the output log (by ">&" use) may be a problem if you want to edit the file. Is possibles to make a filter to extract all special symbols used to color the output. To make the filter just.
   
   ```bash
   make filter
   make install-filter
   ```
   
   BRAM's models needs a lot of input files. One of them is the Initial and boundary conditions (IC). This files is created from a global model data. Two diferents data input must be created, from NCEP model GFS or from ERA5 data. To create the IC data you must create the PRE-BRAMS utility.
   
   ```bash
   make pre-brams
   make install-pre-brams
   ```

## 4. Download tables, fixed files and a test case
   
   A series of fixed files and tables are required to run the model. You can get them by downloading the compressed file available in the ftp area. This file has 16GB and may take a while to download. It depends on your network speed. We advise you to check the checksum of the file to make sure that the download has not broken it.
   
   ```bash
   cd {YOUR_DIR}/bin
   cd ..
   wget http://ftp.cptec.inpe.br/pesquisa/bramsrd/BRAMS-6.0/test_set_data/MD5SUM
   wget http://ftp.cptec.inpe.br/pesquisa/bramsrd/BRAMS-6.0/test_set_data/brams6.0_test_bin.tar.xz
   md5sum brams6.0_test_bin.tar.xz
   cat MD5SUM
   tar -xvf brams6.0_test_bin.tar.xz
   ```

## 5. Running a small meteorological case
   
   The BRAMS Model is a limited area model and therefore requires input data from outputs from a global model. In the test case presented here, these data are already ready and available. For "expert" cases a new document shows how to get this data and generate it. The BRAMS model runs in 3 distinct phases, using the same namelist named RAMSIN:
   
   **i) MAKESFC** - Creates the surface files using the input files that contain global them and adjusts them to the specifications chosen by the user and arranged in the input namelist named RAMSIN.

```mermaid
   graph TD;
   NDVI[(ndvi)]-- datafix_model/NDVI_MODIS_GRADS -->BRAMS;
   TOPOGRAPHY[(topography)]-- datafix_model/topo1km -->BRAMS;
   SST[(sst)]-- datafix_model/sst_week -->BRAMS;

   BRAMS-- dataout/SFC -->SSTFPFX[(sst_OQ3g)]
   BRAMS-- dataout/SFC -->NDVIFPFX[(ndv_OQ3g)]
```

   **ii) MAKEVFILE** - From the global data the phase creates the files with the boundary conditions and initial conditions interpolating them to the specifications chosen by the user and arranged in the RAMSIN.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    IC[(IC)]-- datain/GRADS -->BRAMS;
    RAMSIN(RAMSIN_VFL)-.->BRAMS
    style RAMSIN fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    BRAMS-- dataout/IVAR -->IVAR[(ivar)]
```

   **iii) INITIAL** - This is the phase of model time integration where prediction data will be produced as specified in the RAMSIN. 

```mermaid
graph TD;
    RAMSIN(RAMSIN_INI)-.->BRAMS
    TABLES(tables...)-. tables -->BRAMS
    style RAMSIN fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px

    BRAMS-- dataout/HIS -->HIS[(history)]
    BRAMS-- dataout/ANL -->ANA[(analisys)]
```

> WARNING: The first two phases (i and ii) should only be rotated with 1 processor!

   The test case is small enough to run on a laptop or desktop with 3 processors and with 8GB memory. It covers an area as shown in the figure below.

   ![](http://ftp.cptec.inpe.br/pesquisa/bramsrd/BRAMS-6.0/docs/fig1.png)

   This area is configured in RAMSIN with 60x60x45 points (x,y,z), 20 km of horizontal resolution (surface) and is centered at 22.6S, 45.2W. The test only allows it to run for 24 hours of forecast. After the end of the round, one can verify the behavior of the model by comparing the results that were produced and are in {YOUR_BIN_AREA}/dataout/POST with those stored in the {YOUR_BIN_AREA}/dataout/POST_COMPARE area. To look at the outputs (GRADS/CTL format) you need to know how to use grads software   

> WARNING: Make sure your environment is tuned to use the packages installed in the pre-requirements (PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH). To look at the outputs (GRADS/CTL format) you need to know how to use grads software.

```bash
cd {YOUR_BIN_AREA}
mpirun -np 1 brams-6.0 -f RAMSIN_SFC_MID
mpirun -np 1 brams-6.0 -f RAMSIN_VFL_MID
mpirun -np 3 brams-6.0 -f RAMSIN_INI_MID
```

A series of logs will be shown on the screen in each of the 3 phases. Be aware of errors reported in these logs. Often there are non-existent files that have not been properly downloaded in the download or the system has some limitation. In the INITIAL phase you can follow the integrations by looking at the screen. It shows each timestep performed and other important information. See for example the figure below that shows part of these messages.

![](http://ftp.cptec.inpe.br/pesquisa/bramsrd/BRAMS-6.0/docs/fig2.png)

## 6. How to see the data outputs
   
   The output of model as you read above is in GRADS file. May be used another formats but we will show how in expert users guide. If you are using Ubuntu Linux or some Debian derivated Linux you can install grads in a simple way, using apt-get command:
   
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install grads
   ```
   
   To install grads right from source, please, see the information on site [GrADS Downloads](http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/downloads.php). Pay attention on the necessary libraries explained on [GrADS Supplibs](http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/gadoc/supplibs2.html).
   
   To learn about grads we recommend to read the document [Grads Manual from NCEP](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/international/grads/Advanced_GrADS_Manual.pdf).

## 7. How to filter the log output
   
   Supposed you run the model and put the output in a file. See example:
   
   ```bash
   cd {YOUR_BIN_AREA}
   mpirun -np 3 brams-6.0 -f RAMSIN_INI_MID >& output.txt
   ```
   
   If you open the file output.txt using a specific editor (for example: vi) you will see all escape characters used for color the output. Example below (a small peace of output log read by vi editor):
   
   ```
   +--------------+--------------+
   |  variable    |    grid 1    |
   +--------------+--------------+
   ^[[30m^[[47m|NNXP          |          0060|^[[0m
   ^[[0m|NNYP          |          0060|^[[0m
   ^[[30m^[[47m|NNZP          |          0045|^[[0m
   ^[[0m|NXTNEST       |          0000|^[[0m
   ^[[30m^[[47m|NSTRATX       |          0001|^[[0m
   ^[[0m|NSTRATY       |          0001|^[[0m
   ```
   
   This may appear a little bit confused. To solve the problema you must only run the filter (created in item 3 above) that comes with BRAMS model. Try:
   
   ```bash
   filter output.txt
   ```
   
   And then, you can see the same file with this look:

```
+--------------+--------------+
|  variable    |    grid 1    |
+--------------+--------------+
|NNXP          |          0060|
|NNYP          |          0060|
|NNZP          |          0045|
|NXTNEST       |          0000|
|NSTRATX       |          0001|
|NSTRATY       |          0001|
```

## 8. How to generate Initial and Boundary conditions (IC) from global data
   
   The program "pre" created in item 3 above is the program that get data from global input files and converted them to IC for BRAMS. First of all you must edit a namelist file named **pre.nml**. See the example below:
   
   ```
   $ARGS_INPUT
   
   !!!!! DATE !!!!!
   
   init_year  = 2020,
   init_month = 08,
   init_day   = 18,
   init_hour  = 0,
   final_year = 2020,
   final_month= 08,
   final_day = 19,
   final_hour = 00,
   
   !!!!! TIME STEP !!!!!!!
   
   step  = 6, !Timestep in hours
   
   !!!!! ATMOS !!!!!
   atmos_type   = 1, !0=DP, 1=GFS Grib2, 2=ERA5
   atmos_prefix ='gfs.t00z.pgrb2.0p25.f',
   atmos_sufix  ='.2020081800.grib2',
   atmos_idir   ='./datain/GFS/',
   levels = 23,
   initial_latitude = -70., !initial latitude for domain of model (-90 to 90)  
   final_latitude  = 20., !final latitude for domain of model(-90 to 90)
   initial_longitude = 250., !initial longitude for domain of model (0 to 360)
   final_longitude = 358., !Final longitude for domain of model (0 to 360)
   
   !!!!! CHEM !!!!!! 
   chem_type     = 1, !0 = no Chem, 1 = CAMS 
   chem_idir  = "./datafix_cams/",
   chem1_prefix ='',
   chem1_sufix  ='-CAMS-EC-2010-2019-AMS',
   
   !!!!! OUTPUT !!!!!
   out_type   = 2, !0=text, 1=VFM, 2=Grads
   out_prefix = 'IC',
   out_sufix  = '',
   out_dir    = './datain/GRADS/',
   
   $END
   ```
   
   The namelist is prepared for test case you have downloaded in item 4.  After you edit it you must run the pre.
   
   ```bash
   ./pre
   ```
   
   A lot of information will be show in screen and some files with IC will be write in the **out_dir** you fill in namelist.
   
   ```
     $ls datain/GRADS -latr

   ```
   
   This files will be used as input for BRAMS´Model.

## 9. Download GFS Data for model
   
   The BRAMS comes with a script in bash that get data from GFS from NCEP site. To get the data just run the script passing year, month, day and output folder.
   
   ```bash
   ./getGFS.sh 2021 10 02 ./datain/GFS/
   ```
   
    In the example above gfs data is downloaded for 02Oct2021 and the data will be put in ./datain/GFS/ directory.
